Some weights of the model checkpoint at microsoft/deberta-v3-large were not used when initializing DebertaV2Model: ['mask_predictions.LayerNorm.bias', 'lm_predictions.lm_head.dense.weight', 'mask_predictions.LayerNorm.weight', 'mask_predictions.classifier.bias', 'mask_predictions.dense.bias', 'lm_predictions.lm_head.bias', 'lm_predictions.lm_head.dense.bias', 'lm_predictions.lm_head.LayerNorm.weight', 'mask_predictions.dense.weight', 'lm_predictions.lm_head.LayerNorm.bias', 'mask_predictions.classifier.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing DebertaV2Model from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing DebertaV2Model from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
